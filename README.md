# Data Work
As of the time of writing (Oct 2022) 'Data Work' to me is data analysis and data science dabbling that is suitable for my public (non-work) github profile. 

Files in this repo might include sql files, notebook files and python scripts. 

Naming should be reasonably logical and link (for example) a sql script that pulls data from a source to a notebook file that explores the dataset resulting from that sql script. 

See: 
'h_rank_15_days.sql'
&
'15 days of sql.ipynb'

# References to notebooks and/or plots
By this I refer to any kind of graphical plotting with seaborn or matplotlib with data preparation using pandas and/or numpy. You might see a smattering of nascent machine learning.

Public datasets used in this repo:

# Sql Scripts
At the time of writing 1 - the 'final' hacker rank prep question for the sql module. Again, this is just some publicly shareable work separate from my work-work.
